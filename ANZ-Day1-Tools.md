# You're not as efficient as you could be, period

## Teams are using more modern tools than the old standbys of SharePoint and email

# So why wouldn't you?

# Let's start with email

Multitasking with email may seem like it's productive but it's mostly distracting

Email takes up around 28% of the average desk workerâ€™s day

It's been estimated to take up to an average of 23 minutes to get back to the task at hand

Sometimes you forget to answer an email and it will frustrate the sender

# The dreaded
# Reply-All...

---

# Phone calls

Can sometimes be very distracting, both to you and the people around you

1-to-1 communication is great for certain things, but useless for team communication

# Modern tools

Modern tools are allowing for semi-synchronous communication and collaboration

Across regions and timezones

Answering something in a chat is faster than an email

Visualizing tasks are better than having them in an out-of-date spreadsheet

# Integrations and automation

# IFTTT
## If This Then That

Makes your personal life easier with great integrations to things like Dropbox, RSS Feeds, Facebook and many more

Something happens in one place and jumpstarts a workflow to another thing
